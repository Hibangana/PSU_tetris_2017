Tetris project !

3 weeks long project

The goal of this project unlike what you may think, is to make a debug mode for the Tetris game.

User can change inputs, keys and many other things.

It comes with a tetriminos folder. (Can be edited)

To compile:

make

To run:

./tetris --help

./tetris --debug

Something like the following also works:

./tetris --debug -L 12 -l RKey1 -r RKey2 -t P -d RKey3 -p RKey4 -w --map-size={21,20}
